Simply choose a long pasta – bucatini or spaghetti works well – buy a jar of your favorite tomato sauce (low sugar and no added tomato paste are the most healthy and flavorful), some cream cheese, and you'll have dinner ready in 20 minutes or less.</p>\r\n          <h2 id=\"hotel\">Hotel1 name1</h2>\r\n          <img src=\"/72f681423764d09216da37d41783dfcb.PNG\" alt=\"img\" id=\"img\">\r\n          <p id=\"desc\">When you are craving carbs, nothing is quite as satisfying as a plate of pasta. Whether you break out your best pasta pot for a stovetop recipe like spaghetti or tortellini or fill up your favorite casserole dish to make a baked pasta like lasagna, noodles paired with the perfect sauce and topped with a mountain of freshly grated cheese are the ultimate comfort food. And, while we would gladly gobble up any dish of pasta you put in front of us, there are a few that are undeniable masterpieces — recipes that have amassed hundreds of 5-star ratings and positive reviews from fans. These are those recipes. So, prepare to want to make them all — starting with the super popular baked feta pasta you’ve seen all over TikTok. It’s easy to see why the recipe has achieved such fame: Cherry tomatoes and a whole block of feta are baked until soft and melty, then tossed with garlic, basil and cooked noodles for a beautifully cheesy dish. Better make a double batch!</p>\r\n        \r\n          <div class=\"btn\">\r\n          <button id=\"prev\">Prev</button>\r\n          <button id=\"random\">Random</button>\r\n          <button id=\"next\">Next</button>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  <!-- <h1>My Restraunt Menu</h1>\r\n  <div id=\"app\"></div> -->\r\n  <script src=\"/9a9569e9d73f33740eada95275da7f30.js\"></script>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"8eaaad0130b119701478e0634db05831","cacheData":{}}
